      <p>I was born in Tehran and migrated to US in early 1980s. In addition to academics, I participated in
        organized
        sports. I have been playing soccer since I was about 5 years old. In 1980s I attended a junior college prior
        to
        attending the university for degree program. As a member of the International Student Club, I and two other
        students, were
        able to obtain permission from the state and the president of the college to start a soccer team. </p>

      <p>Although
        we were not able
        to win any championship during my participation, we were able to participate in tournaments which allowed
        few
        players to join major university's soccer teams and compete in NCAA games.</p>
        <p> After completing my degree, I
          obtained a real estate and insurance license in the state of Georgia and have been practicing real estate
          since 1995.</p>
